I'm TomCube.

# Project(s)

I'm currently working on [Tasking](https://github.com/yomcube/tasking), a free website to help manage your tasks. I'm focusing more on [tasking-server](https://github.com/yomcube/tasking-server), which as the name suggests, is the server part of Tasking. My goal is to make a server to save the tasks so that they are not lost on the tab closing.
